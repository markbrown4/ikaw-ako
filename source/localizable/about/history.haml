  %h1 History

%p
  Towards the end of World War II, Japanese military had been pushed by Negrense guerrillas and American soldiers to the mountain area of Patag, Silay City in what is known as the last stand on Negros Island.
%p
  It was during this time, a story of heroism emerged when Lieutenant Junichiro Doi, radio operator of the Japanese Imperial Army, defied an order to bomb the local church, saving many innocent Filipino lives.
%p
  Many years after the war had come to an end, Mr. Doi then a teacher in Japan, returned to Negros to attend a memorial service. It was there that he witnessed first hand, the struggles of post-war life within the community and later shared his experiences with his friend, Mr. Goto (Director, Ikaw-Ako).  Together they decided that they would work to rebuild the relationship between Japanese and Filipino people and improve the lives of locals through environmental projects, this lead to the establishment of Ikaw-Ako Japan - Philippines Partnership for Environmental Protection in 1996.
